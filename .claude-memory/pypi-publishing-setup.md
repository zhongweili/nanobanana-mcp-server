# PyPI Publishing Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ Complete Publishing Workflow Ready

Your nanobanana-mcp-server is now fully configured for PyPI publishing with modern uv-based tooling.

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Immediate Publishing (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and test upload to TestPyPI
uv run python scripts/build.py
uv run python scripts/upload.py  # Choose option 1 (TestPyPI)

# Test installation from TestPyPI
uvx --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ nanobanana-mcp-server

# If testing successful, upload to production
uv run python scripts/upload.py  # Choose option 2 (PyPI)
```

## üìÅ What's Configured

### ‚úÖ Package Configuration
- **pyproject.toml**: Complete metadata, dependencies, scripts, build system
- **__init__.py**: Version info and package exports  
- **Console Scripts**: `nanobanana-mcp-server` and `nanobanana-mcp` commands
- **FastMCP Entry Point**: `nanobanana-mcp-server` for FastMCP CLI
- **Build System**: Hatchling with proper package inclusion

### ‚úÖ Automated Scripts
- **scripts/build.py**: Comprehensive build automation with uv
- **scripts/upload.py**: Interactive upload with safety checks
- Both scripts handle dependencies, validation, and error recovery

### ‚úÖ Documentation
- **docs/PYPI_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md**: Updated for uv workflow
- **docs/PUBLISHING_WORKFLOW.md**: Complete reusable workflow guide

### ‚úÖ Verification
- Build test successful: Creates 252KB package (67.7KB wheel + 184.3KB source)
- All required files present and configured correctly
- Entry points properly configured for both direct execution and FastMCP

## üéØ Next Steps for Publishing

### Prerequisites (One-time setup)
1. **Create accounts**: PyPI and TestPyPI
2. **Generate API tokens** for both platforms
3. **Configure ~/.pypirc** with tokens (see workflow guide)

### Publishing Process
```bash
# Standard workflow
uv run python scripts/build.py && uv run python scripts/upload.py
```

### After Publishing
Users will be able to install with:
```bash
# With uvx (recommended)
uvx nanobanana-mcp-server

# With pip (traditional)
pip install nanobanana-mcp-server

# Commands available
nanobanana-mcp-server --help
nanobanana-mcp --help

# FastMCP integration
fastmcp run nanobanana-mcp-server
```
